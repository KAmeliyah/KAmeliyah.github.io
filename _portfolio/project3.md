### Introduction
This was my first ever game jam. I had heard of them before and seen what others had done during theirs so I was excited to join one for myself. It was also the first time I'd worked in a multi-disciplined team of artists, designers and programmers which was fun for me.

Our prompt was "Combination". Our team, Blue Shells, chose to make a puzzle game with combat elements. The goal was to escape from a dungeon by solving a puzzle and then beating an enemy. I'll highlight my contributions to the project in the following sections.

### Character Movement


### Combat Mechanics

### Scene Management
