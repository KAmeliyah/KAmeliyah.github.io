### Accolades
**3rd Overall**
**Best 2D Art**

### Introduction
This was my first ever game jam. I had heard of them before and seen what others had done during theirs so I was excited to join one for myself. It was also the first time I'd worked in a multi-disciplined team of artists, designers and programmers which was fun, new experience.

Our prompt was "Combination". Our team, Blue Shells, chose to make a puzzle game with RPG elements. The goal was to escape from a dungeon by solving a puzzle and then beating an enemy. I'll highlight my contributions to the project in the following sections.

### Character Movement
As a base starting point, we wanted player controlled movement to immerse the player into the escape storyline. I was responsible for coding the movement and making sure player actions synced up with the animations Oyku drew. I scripted the 2D physics so that the character would interact correctly with the level tiles. To check for ground when the character would jump, I used a layer mask and Physics2D boxcast to check for collisions. I felt it worked really well and I moved forward with the solution.

### Combat Mechanics
A boss before gaining freedom was a story beat we wanted to hit. So, we came up with a rock, paper, scissors style system using cards. The player and enemy can play a card each and whoever wins, deals damage.

For drawing player cards, I wrote a function that randomly select a card to draw.

I think if I were to come back to this project, I would write a function to shuffle the deck instead to **compare the performance** of the two randomisation methods.

I wrote an audio manager script to play sound clips whenever there was a successful hit.
