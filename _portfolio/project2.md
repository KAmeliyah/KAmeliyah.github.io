### Introduction
For this Code Jam, our prompt was given by Bournemouth University's Sustainability team to develop a prototype of an "interactive experience" that the team could be used for people to play with to explore making the buildings on campus net zero on energy consumption. Since our team was made up of a majority of Creative Technology students, we felt it would be best to make a game. We came up with the idea of a take on a Real-Time-Strategy game where the player takes control of the uni's budget for a year.

My contributions are focused on the non-diegetic in-game shop.

### Scriptable Objects
Since the shop contains multiple items that have similar components, I decided it would be best to use Unity's Scriptable Objects \[SO]. Since each building has it's own shop, SOs made it easy to swap different upgrades in and out as necessary. This method also saved on memory consumption as SOs don't need to be instantiated the way that Monobehaviours do.
